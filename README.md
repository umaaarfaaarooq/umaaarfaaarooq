👋 Hi, I’m Muhammad Umar Farooq, a passionate and results-driven Senior IT Security & Cloud Engineer with over 7 years of experience in fortifying infrastructures and managing secure cloud environments.
👀 I’m interested in cloud-native security solutions, zero-trust architecture, advanced threat detection, and streamlining compliance frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001.
🌱 I’m currently mastering Microsoft 365 and Azure Cloud administration, Wazuh for endpoint and SIEM solutions, and proactive incident response automation.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cloud migration strategies, implementing Wazuh and SIEM platforms, and enhancing organizational cybersecurity resilience.
